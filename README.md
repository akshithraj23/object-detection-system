# Real-Time Object Detection System
Our real-time object detection system utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, a cutting-edge deep learning model renowned for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. YOLO operates by dividing input images into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell simultaneously. This single-pass approach allows for lightning-fast inference times while maintaining high detection accuracy, making it ideal for real-time applications.

Powered by OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), our system offers a user-friendly interface for seamless integration and deployment. OpenCV provides a comprehensive suite of tools and algorithms for image and video processing, including loading pre-trained models, performing inference, and visualizing detected objects. With its versatility and efficiency, our real-time object detection system delivers precise and low-latency detection results, paving the way for professional-grade usability in various domains.
